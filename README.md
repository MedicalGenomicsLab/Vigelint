<h1> Vigelint - The Variants in Gene Linking Tool </h1>

Vigelint makes it possible to determine how our understanding of the molecular components associated with a disease are changing. This is achieved by characterising how the genes associated with the disease change and how the variants within those genes change. To achieve this, Vigelint uses the information captured by PanelApp and ClinVar. While the manuscript that describes Vigelint was used to determine the changes in the epilespy, we have designed to tool to characterise the changes in any panel from PanelApp / PanelApp Australia, or any static gene list. An overview of the tools that make up Vigelint is shown in Figure 1.

***Vigelint is composed of:***
1. PADA-WAN 2.0
2. CVPO
3. JEDI - Static Gene List Mode
4. JEDI - Evolving Panel Mode

Detailed instructions for each part of the Vigelint Pipeline is available in each folder. 

To run JEDI - Evolving Panel Mode, you must first run PADA-WAN and CVPO.
