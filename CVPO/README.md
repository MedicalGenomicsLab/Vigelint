<h1> CVPO - ClinVar Peroid Organiser </h1>

**CVPO** has been designed to take information the monthly gene specific summary files from ClinVar and combine them into a single, queriable matrix. 

An overview of CVPO can be seen in Figure 1.

# System requirements
CVPO requires Python/3.9.13

CVPO has been tested on a local, desktop computer (MacOS 13.3.1) and a cluster computer running qsun.

## Python dependencies
- pandas 1.1.5
- argparse
- re
- time


# CVPO Overview 

CVPO is broken into two parts, a manual part, and a automatic part.

**Note** Unlike the other tools inthe Vigelint, CVPO requires a number of manual steps to acquire the data, asign the correct date to these files, and to move them into the correct location. 

# Manual Steps

 - _Manual Step 1:_ **Download the Gene Specific Summary Files**
Navigate to:
  [ClinVar FTP Archive](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/tab_delimited/archive/)

Download the _Gene Specific Summary_ file for each period, that you wish to merge into a single matrix.

 - _Manual Step 2:_ **Rename the Gene Specific Summary Files**
Once downloaded and extracted, the resulting file will be named _gene_specific_summary.txt_. Unfortunately, this process strips the time period from the name of the file.
As ClinVar uses an alternative method to define a month (A Thursday close to the start of the month) to the one used by used by PADA-WAN (11:59pm on the last day of the month), this provides us with an oppurtunity to assign a consistent time peroid to each.

CVPO has been designed to expect files in the following format 'year'_'month'-gene_specific_summary.txt. In this model, year should be written 2024, and months should be written as two digit numbers (i.e. May is 05).

For example; this means the _Gene Specific Summary file_ originally labelled as gene_specific_summary_2023-06.txt.gz (released on the 1st of June 2023) will be renamed to be 2023_05-gene_specific_summary.txt as it is the most comparible to the PADA-WAN data from May 2023 (representing PanelApp on 2023-05-31).
 
 - _Manual Step 3:_ **Move The Gene Specific Summary Files**

To ensure that CVPO can analyse each file, each renamed file should be stored in a seperate folder.

 - _Manual Step 4:_ **Download the Ensembl ID to NCBI ID table from biomart**

# Automated Steps 

The next part of CVPO is automated. To run CVPO, modify the attached parameters file (cvpo_params.txt), and use the following commands:

    python3 CVPO.py --file-path cvpo_params.txt

In the params file you will need to list:
1. The location of the _Gene Specific Summary File_ (GSS)
2. The location of the output matrix
3. The location and name of the Ensembl to NCBI file
