# PADA-WAN Overview 
 
 PADA-WAN is made of two parts. 
 
 ***Part 1*** is responsible for downloading and summarising the information from PanelApp
 
 ***Part 2*** focuses on characterising change and an option set of R scripts makes it possible to visualise these changes

# PADA-WAN Components

This section describes the individal scripts that make up PADA-WAN.
 
## 1.1 - Download IDs

The first script in the PADA-WAN pipeline queries the PanelApp / PanelApp Australia API to retrieve a list containing all available panels. In addition to this informaiton, this script also collects information about each panelâ€™s numeric panel-ID, and super panel / rare-disease status. Information about the most current version, the date of release of this version and the number of genetic entities are also downloaded. 

This script requires a parameters file, which contains information about the version of PanelApp to query, as well as the the input / output directories. The parameter file also contains the token files for both PanelApp Australia and Genomics England instance of PanelApp. 

An example of the parameter file can be found in /PADA-WAN/1-1/

To run this script use following command:
  python3 1-1_Downlad-IDs.py --file-path parameters_file.txt

If run correctly it will produce a .tsv file containing information for each panel in the PanelApp of your choice.
